# Try Vegan

[Try Vegan](https://delboy.github.io/Try-Vegan/) is a site hoping to entice people to try a vegan diet. It does this by informing them of the benifits of veganism and subsequently aiding them with sample recipe ideas. The aim is to then get them to sign up for our 14 day meal plan.

## USer Experience (UX)

- __Design__
    - Colour scheme
        - The colour scheme I chose for the site is pink (RGB 26,98,98) and grey (RGB 100,100,100).
        - All grey links will either highlight pink on hover or show a pink underline.  

    - Typography
        - Lato is the main font throughout the site using Sans serif as the back up. Lato is a very standard looking font and easy to read which is the look I wanted. 
        - Dancing Script was used once to create part of the logo. I liked the way the letters had a 'flow' to them giving them a gentle nature which was fitting for the site.

    - Imagery
        - All the images to have a light and airy feel to them. The main hero image on the landing page also fits the colour scheme with the pink watermelon flesh.

- __Wireframes__
