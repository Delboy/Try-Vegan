# Try Vegan

[Try Vegan](https://delboy.github.io/Try-Vegan/) is a responsive website designed to inform the user of the benifits of veganism and aid them with vegan recipes and meal plans. The site is targeted towards non-vegans who are looking to make the change, be it for animal rights, health or environmental reasons. The site will be useful for anyone interested in learning about veganism and looking to trial some vegan recipes.

## USer Experience (UX)

Vistors to this page would be people interested in learning more about veganism and especially vegan food. On visting the site they should be able to:
- Understand the main purpose of the website.
- Navigate around the site and to all page.

 
- __Design__
    - Colour scheme
        - The colour scheme I chose for the site is pink (RGB 26,98,98) and grey (RGB 100,100,100).
        - All grey links will either highlight pink or show a pink underline on hover.  

    - Typography
        - Lato is the main font throughout the site using Sans serif as the back up. Lato is a very standard looking font and easy to read.
        - Dancing Script was used once to create part of the logo. The font has a 'flow' giving the logo a gentle nature which is fitting for the site.

    - Imagery
        - All of the images have a light and airy feel. The main hero image on the landing page also fits the colour scheme with the pink of the watermelon.
        - The recipe images are simplisitic which ties in with the look of the site.

- __Landing Page image__

    - The landing page hero image is in fitting with the sites goal and has a clear text overlay suggesting the user to try the 14 day meal plan. 
    - Hovering over the text will create a shadow round the box giving the notion that the text is a clickable button. Clicking the box will link the user to the sign up page.
